Kessler Chaos
=============

A mod that adds more deadly space debris to Kerbal Space Program.

How it works
------------

Adds random debris cloud encounters when flying. Both the likelyhood of
encountering a debris cloud and its severity depend on how much
normal debris you have floating around in the sphere of influence.
This should give you an incentive to keep space clean (or not
depending on your proclivities).

Upcoming feature wishlist
-------------------------

* Real trajectories for debris clouds rather than random encounters
* Modeled chain reactions for a proper Kessler Syndrome
* Improved graphical effects
* Sound effects for the small impacts that don't create explosions
* Block timewarp when encountering a debris cloud (no cheating)
* Allow debris clouds to affect "on rails" vessles
* Debris detector vessel parts to provide alarms and early warnings
* Debris mitigation vessel parts such as laser brooms and "deflector dishes"

Build and Installation
----------------------

Open the solution with monodevelop, make sure the references to
Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll come from ksp's
KSP_Data/Managed/ directory. Build it then copy kesslerchaos.dll from the
output directory to ksp's GameData folder.

If you've just downloaded the pre-built zip file, extract zip to the
"GameData" subdirectory of your Kerbal Space Program install.
